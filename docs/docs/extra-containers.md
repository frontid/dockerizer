There are multiple containers that can be used but are not enabled by default since they are non common tools for everyone.  
Of course you can enable and use them. Find here the instructions for enabling them.


## Blackfire
https://blackfire.io will help to measure times and memory of page loads and more. 
In order to enable it you need to:
- first you need to have a blackfire account. You'll need to grab from the account the Client ID, Client Token, Server ID and Server Token.
- uncomment from docker-compose.yml the `blackfire` container
- set the BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID and BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN to the `blackfire` container in the docker-compose.yml
- uncomment from docker-compose.override.yml the `blackfire` container
- uncomment from docker-compose.override.yml, in the `php` container, the environment variables:
```bash
PHP_BLACKFIRE: 1
BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID: CLIENT_XXXXXX  
BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN: CLIENT_YYYYY  
PHP_BLACKFIRE_AGENT_HOST: "${PROJECT_NAME}_blackfire"
```
- set variables BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID and BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN

## Apache Solr [WIP]
Create dir with solr core configuration (download [https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr]()) under /web/setup/conf/solr/core/
uncomment lines for solr in docker-compose.override.yml
make sure you have defined solr variables from .example.docker.env in your /web/.docker.env file
Once previous steps are finished, run the project as usual with `dk start` and create the core running this command: `solr create`.  
  
And that's it, now you have a new core. You can check it at [youprojectname.solr.localhost]()

## Terminus
You can run terminus by enabling it in the docker-compose.override.yml. Then you need to set into your `.docker.env` file the MACHINE_TOKEN and SITE constants.
Once done you can run:

```bash
expose terminus
terminus auth:login --machine-token=$MACHINE_TOKEN
terminus drush $SITE.qa uli
terminus drush $SITE.qa status
```
